# 2023

This years languages (probably): Python, Haskell for fun,
and C++ or maybe Rust if I need speed.

Another year of trying to be fast,
although being in Tokyo and having to solve puzzles at 2pm might become a problem.

Introducing this year: usage of a justfile for running tasks, because it's awesome.
